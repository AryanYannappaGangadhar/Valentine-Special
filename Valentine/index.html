  <h2>My Love Letter 💌</h2>
  <p id="typingText">
My Love,

I don’t know when it happened exactly, but somewhere between our conversations, your smile, and the way you exist so effortlessly, you became my favorite part of every day. Loving you feels natural, like breathing—something my heart does without being asked.

You have this beautiful way of making the world softer for me. When I’m with you, worries feel smaller, time feels kinder, and everything makes a little more sense. Your laughter is my comfort, your voice is my calm, and your presence feels like home.

I admire you more than words can explain—your strength, your kindness, the way you care so deeply. You inspire me to be better, to love harder, and to dream bigger. You make me believe in things I never thought I deserved.

I want you to know that I choose you, every single day. In the happy moments, the quiet ones, and even the difficult times, I want to walk beside you. I don’t promise perfection, but I promise honesty, effort, loyalty, and a love that grows stronger with time.

Thank you for being you, for loving me the way you do, and for holding a place in your heart for me. My heart is yours—today, tomorrow, and always.

Forever yours,
❤️
